- add support for calling via webservices any existing module operation, much in teh same way as views are

- allow caller to set the encoding level and attr. filter to be used per variable on the variables returned by ezp.view.xxx;
  also allow to filter out desired vars

- add support for the SkipViewAccessCheck ini file parameter

- add ordering definition: we depend on ggws, ezpo_inspector
- add ant build file

- be smarter about method injection: use __call instead of creating N functions in FunctionList

- implement ezp.inspect in xlrpc/jsonrpc, fetch* and view* in ezjsc

1. more docs

2. list kernel modules that:
 - do a clean shutdown on their own
 - do not use templates
 - exit by a redirect
 - do not run a template (or run more than one / a variable one)

2b. implement some filtering of ezp.view.* based on that info

3. other ideas: besides running views, we could run
- fetch functions [DONE!]
- other operations?
