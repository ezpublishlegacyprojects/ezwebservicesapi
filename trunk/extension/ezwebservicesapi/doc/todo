1. more docs

2. list kernel modules that:
 - do a clean shutdown on their own
 - do not use templates
 - exit by a redirect
 - do not run a template (or run more than one / a variable one)

2b. implement some filtering of fetch.view.* based on that info

3. other ideas: besides running views, we could run
- fetch functions [DONE!]
- other operations?
