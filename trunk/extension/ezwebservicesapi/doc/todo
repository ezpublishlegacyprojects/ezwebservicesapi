- make sure that debug messages printed when bad params are received in ws calls
  or ws called without perms are equivalent bewteen ezjsc and xmlrpc/jsonrpc protocols

- allow caller to set the encoding level and attr. filter to be used per variable on the variables returned by ezp.view.xxx;
  also allow to filter out desired vars

- add support for the SkipViewAccessCheck ini file parameter

- add a php method that returns the currently active ws transports (ggws, ezjscore, ...)

- add ant build file

- be smarter about method injection: use __call instead of creating N functions in FunctionList

- allow usage of plain POST vars for params passed to ezjscore webservices as alternative to json-encoded strings in ws name

1. more docs

2. list kernel modules that:
 - do a clean shutdown on their own
 - do not use templates
 - exit by a redirect
 - do not run a template (or run more than one / a variable one)

2b. implement some filtering of ezp.view.* based on that info

3. other ideas: besides running views, we could run
- fetch functions [DONE!]
- module operations [DONE!]
- other stuff?
