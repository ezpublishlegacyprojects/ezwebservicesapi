Changes from 0.1 to 0.2 - released 2010/xx/yy

*General:
- improved the encoding of ezpersistentobject descendant classes
  (eg. ezcontentobjectreenode as returned by fetch content/list):
  now the proper type is enforced for scalar attributes

*Bugfixes:
- make sure this extension is enabled as JSONRPC provider, and that it registers
  webservices for jsonrpc also when RegisterAllProtocolsFunctions=disabled
- remove one message in warning log that appeared under normal conditions
- set the default nesting level of object decoding for fetch results to 1, as it
  is what was in use actually; use the same level whether a single object or an
  array is returned
