Changes from 0.1 to 0.2 - released 2010/11/8

*General:

- added ezjscore support. Now all webservices can be called using the 3
  protocols: ezjscore, xmlrpc, jsonrpc

- added a new webservice: ezp.inspect. It is used for drilldown analysis of
  eZPersistentObject subclasses, and is needed for a very cool new debug
  template operator in the ezdebug_operator extension

- added a new set of webservices allowing to execute all exisitng module
  operations.
  Ex: ezp.operation.content.hide (ezp::operation::content::hide in ezjscore syntax)
  Here again, policy limitations are available with one limitation per operation

- improved the encoding of ezpersistentobject descendant classes
  (eg. ezcontentobjectreenode as returned by fetch content/list):
  now the proper type is enforced for scalar attributes

- improved the description of webservices that map fetch functions and views from
  the eZPublish kernel: if the ezpersistentobject extension is installed, the
  description of a method returned by calls to system.methodHelp will be more
  detailed

- invoking via ezp.view.* views that result in a redirect to another page does
  not result in a webservice error anymore, but in a response with a 'redirect'
  member, containing the url that eZPublish is redirecting to

*Bugfixes:

- fix calls to ezp.view.* that needed post or unordered parameters.
  NB: this is a backward incompatible change: the API of all ezp.view.* methods
  has changed!

- make sure this extension is enabled as JSONRPC provider, and that it registers
  webservices for jsonrpc also when RegisterAllProtocolsFunctions=disabled

- remove one message in warning log that appeared under normal conditions

- set the default nesting level of object decoding for fetch results to 1, as it
  is what was in use actually; use the same level whether a single object or an
  array is returned

- remove leftover debugging printouts in ezp.view.xxx webservices
