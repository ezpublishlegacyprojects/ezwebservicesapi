Changes from 0.1 to 0.2 - released 2010/xx/yy

*General:

- improved the encoding of ezpersistentobject descendant classes
  (eg. ezcontentobjectreenode as returned by fetch content/list):
  now the proper type is enforced for scalar attributes

- added a new webservice: ezp.inspect. It is used for drilldown analysis of
  eZPersistentObject subclasses, and is needed for a very cool new debug
  template operator in the ezdebug_operator extension

- added ezjscore support. Now all webservices can be called using the 3
  protocols: ezjscore, xmlrpc, jsonrpc

*Bugfixes:

- make sure this extension is enabled as JSONRPC provider, and that it registers
  webservices for jsonrpc also when RegisterAllProtocolsFunctions=disabled

- remove one message in warning log that appeared under normal conditions

- set the default nesting level of object decoding for fetch results to 1, as it
  is what was in use actually; use the same level whether a single object or an
  array is returned

- remove leftover debugging printouts in ezp.view.xxx webservices
